# Automaton
*The millionth billionth cellular automata project on Github!*

Automaton is a simple program for processing & visualizing rules of cellular automata (CA) in a 100x100 grid.

## Rule Sets
Each CA is defined as a **Rule Set**, which defines both the colours used by different cell types, as well as the rules used for updating the grid at each time step. As of now, the program has the following rule sets:
- John Conway's "Game of Life" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life)
- Brian Silverman's "Brain" (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brian%27s_Brain)
- Sand simulation
